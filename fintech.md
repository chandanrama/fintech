# Personal Finance - Mint

### Introduction
My father had one bank account where his salary was getting deposited. Withdrawal from the account was limited to make sure savings are high and when there was enough money in the account an house was purchased and a mortgage loan was taken. In all his life he didn't have a credit card but was able to manage to save a lot of money and buy more than house with a simple disciplinary life by valuing each penny.

In the next generation, we have options to have more one than one savings account due to higher APY that we can leverage, more credit cards for all the shopping perks and travel rewards, more investment options including multiple brokerage accounts, automatic rounding accounts , more loans, not just one mortgage and one auto, there are multiple accounts in loans too, college savings funds for the kids and Yes the retirement planning too. All this needs central visibility of where the funds are going if salaried and even more complicated if you are running a business.

## Mint

When Mint was created by Aaron Patzer maybe he tried to solve that exact problem. Mint's primary service allows users to track bank, credit card, investment, and loan balances and transactions through a single user interface, as well as create budgets and set financial goals. It took many iterations to get to where they are right now but they have taken the longest way to get here. I will explain why as you read through this. 

Maybe Intuit purchase of that product in 2009 caused them to go slower on launching major features. This is a very old company and has been a fintech unicorn for a while now but features for the consumers has not grown as much. The development of just mint product itself feels very slower and some of the late starters like SoFi have grown leaps and bounds in terms of features 


### 2009 - Game changing year for Mint 
Mint raised over $31M in venture capital funding from DAG Ventures, Shasta Ventures, and First Round Capital, as well as from angel investors including Ram Shriram, an early investor in Google. The latest round of $14M was closed on August 4, 2009, and reported by CEO Aaron Patzer as preemptive. TechCrunch later pegged the valuation of Mint at $140M.

# Business Activities

Account aggregation is the main functionality that involves compiling information from different accounts, which may include bank accounts, credit card accounts, investment accounts, and other consumer or business accounts, into a single place. This may be provided through connecting via an API to the financial institution or provided through "screen scraping" where a user provides the requisite account-access information for an automated system to gather and compile the information into a single page. The security of the account access details as well as the financial information is key to users having confidence in the service.


## Users

This is used by any general consumer who has two or more types of accounts (debit, credit, investment, retirement, etc…) and they need better understanding of their own financial wellness and a means to study if they can hit their financial goals. 

Users have graphical representations of their investments on the basis of range like monthly or weekly. They can customize reports and watch current trend. Mint provides different reports like net worth, spending, net investment, debts, etc which is the main consolidated view that is very useful for budget planning.

# Technology
- When studying slackshare, Its inferred that they have used all kinds of technology there is for the application side of things like having python, java, react, typescript, spring boot, splunk…
- They seem to use jenkins for code deployment and seems to be deployed in AWS or use their tools. 
- Jira, slack, confluence and service now are the various tools used by developers to maintain the technology landscape.
- Mint is secured with 256-bit encryption level.

# Landscape

The financial services sector is accelerating its adoption of digital technology. Paying with cash, participating in in-personal meetings with financial consultants, and even using an ATM are all fading facets of financial services.

Top 3 Digital assets that have a important role in organizations/projects according to a April 2021 report. 
- Custody of Digital assets 45%
- New payment channels or types 42%
- Diversifying Investments or Portfolios 41% 

All reports point to Mint having important consumer data that can be leveraged to provide some excellent products or services to end user.

Where they faltered was lack in innovation in services provided in faster way. 

This is where many other companies did well and I will pick one example Personal Capital.

# Competitor - Personal Capital (A better mint)
Like Mint, Personal Capital is completely free to use and is a web-based application. It works better in a way that focuses more on investment and retirement rather than just letting you know where your is money is spent.
Moreover, it is an app that manages and tracks all your money with proper budgeting and investment options.

- Personal capital is a single platform for both budgeting and investment management that helps you build a better tomorrow.
- It offers a free financial dashboard for tracking all your financial transactions and helps you to spend wisely.
- Investment tracking is also available, hence you can make the right investment at the right time and see where it takes you.
- The best part is that their customer support service is really good. You can contact them 24/7 a week and they will listen to your problems very seriously. Moreover, for wealth management service, they offer live advisors as well to make you clear.
- Security is much better and it includes Two-factor authentication, Read-only platform, 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), Fingerprint scanning, etc.

## Recommendations for Mint
- Lack of reconciliation i.e. the data you downloaded is assumed to be correct and you cannot reconcile against your transactions or bank statements.
- Lack of fine investment tool when compared to its alternatives. It’s OK to use Mint’s investment tool for a short period but one cannot continue using it for the long term.
- They also have very poor customer service support which is claimed by many users.There are several unresolved complaints, unanswered questions, and a lack of support for users.
- Discussion between family or partners on budget and enable accountability via social chats
- Amazon spending is not categorized properly. Maybe that could be one reason customers are not clear on the reliability of their categories 
- All gift and donations category transactions could be an automated tax forms 
- They could expand to have more currencies across the world apart from just Dollar currency
